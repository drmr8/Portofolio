# Data Analyst Portofolio

I'm a Junior Data Analyst. I learned all about data analysis from a bootcamp and online courses. Now, I know how to use tools like SQL, Python, Tableau, and Excel to understand data and find interesting things.

I've made this GitHub profile to show what I can do. You'll find different projects here that I worked on to use what I learned.

## Skills & Tools
Here are some of the tools I've worked with:
* Programming Languages: Python, SQL
* Data Visualization Tools: Tableau, Matplotlib
* Data Processing Tools: Excel, Pandas

Thanks for taking the time to explore my profile! 

Please note, I'm currently in the process of building this portfolio. I'll be updating it with new projects and case studies as I complete them.
Thank you!
